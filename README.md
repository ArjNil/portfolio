# Hi! It's me, N I L V I A
    
##### About me 
I am a chocolate lover and a self learned data analyst, in that order;                                                           
I have interest in data science, cloud computing and machine learning.                         
When I am not growing or learning new skills I am reading,                                 
watching games and looking for handmade ceramic courses.                   
                       
Focus on Power BI, Python, Excel & SQL                              
Here are some of my projects                                 
Hope you dig in!
